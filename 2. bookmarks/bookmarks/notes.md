# Chapter 4: building social website authentication

## Django auth framework
Login, logout, password change, receovery, etc, features
Django auth framework provides authentiation, sessions, permissions, and user groups models, views, and forms
You can always customize these templates, models, forms if you want

## Middleware
middleware is classes with methods that are globally executed during the request or response phase.

django.contrib.auth comes with two middleware classes found in the setting
- AuthenticationMiddleware: associates users with requests using sessions
- SessionMiddleware: handles the current session across requests

The current user is set in the HttpRequest by the authentication middleware. You can access it with request.user in template files
## form clean method
forms.ModelForm comes with built-in clean method which is called to validate form data when is_valid is called
You can override this method or use clean_<fieldname> to apply it to a specific field

## auth password hashing
PBKDF2 hasher is used by default since scrypt which is more secure requires OpenSSL and more memory

## Extending user model: adding profile


# Chapter 5: Oauth Authentication and profile creation pipeline

## Messages
Messaes are stored in a cookie by default (falling back to session storage), and they are displayed and cleared in the next request from the user.

## Context processor
A context processor is a Python function that takes the request object as an argument and returns a dictionary that gets added to the request context which you can access within template files

## Custom authentication backend
DJango allows you to authentiate users against different sources, such as
- the built-in Django authentication system
- LDAP (Lightweight Directory Acess Protocol) servers
- third-party providers

## AUTHENTICATION BACKENDS
The AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS setting includes a list of authentication backends available in the project

The default setting is ['django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend'], which authenticates users against the database using the User model
Whenever authenticate() function is called, DJango tries to authenticate the user against each of the backends defined in AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS one by one

Django provides a simple way to define your own authentication backends. An authentication backend is a class that provides the following two methods
- authenticate(): It takes the request object and user crendentials as parameters. It has to return a user object that matches those credentials if the credentials are valid, or None otherwise. The request parameter is an HttpRequest object, or None if itâ€™s not provided to the authenticate() function.
- get_user(): It takes a user ID parameter and has to return a user object.

## Python SSO (single sign-on) Oauth (open authorization) Steps
1. python -m pip install social-auth-app-django==5.4.0
2. Add app to INSTALLED_APPS and add path to social_django
3. open /etc/hosts file and add 127.0.0.1 mysite.com 
4. include mysite.com in ALLOWED_HOSTS 

The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is the standard for serving websites through a secure connection
The TLS predecessor is the Secure Socekts Layer (SSL)

The Django development server is not able to serve your site through HTTPS since that is not its intended use.
To test the social authentication functionality serving the site through HTTPS, use RunServerPlus extension of the package Django Extensions.
This package contains a collection of useful Django tools.

python -m pip install django-exntesions==3.2.3
python -m pip install werkzeug=3.0.2
- this contains a debugger layer required by the RunServerPlus extension of Django Extensions
python -m pip install pyOpenSSL==24.1.0
- this is required to use the SSL/TLS functionality of RunServerPlus

5. include 'django_extensions' in INSTALLED_APPS
6. python manage.py runserver_plus --cert-file cert.crt
Django Extensions will generate a key and certificate automatically, then, now you can access your site with https with self-generated SSL

7. include 'social_core.backends.google.GoogleOAuth2' in AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS

8. create client id and secret

9. expose <a href="{% url "social:begin" "google-oauth2" %}"> to allow Oauth signin
